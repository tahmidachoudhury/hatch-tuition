    "comment": "Tahmid is a great tutor and a more lovely person. He makes learning more fun and enjoyable and I always look forward to come into learning labs when I know he will be teaching. When I had my first lesson in learning labs, Tahmid was my first tutor. He made sure that I understood everything before moving on and if I don‚Äôt understand the question he would go through it step by step. From time to time he asks how my day is and if I‚Äôm doing alright. He cracks jokes now and then which makes the 2 hour learning time less dull. I have been going to learning labs for 4 weeks, Tahmid is my tutor for chemistry and maths, which is all I do. Every week I look forward to meet Tahmid as he makes me more confident in my learning skills and is overall a great person."
