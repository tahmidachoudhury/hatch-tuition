            In my three years of teaching, I&apos;ve found that this lesson
            duration works best. They give us the time to balance learning
            theory and putting it into practice. You see, one hour just
            isn&apos;t enough for students to understand and apply what
            they&apos;ve learned. With every lesson, we make sure to practice
            exam questions to ensure that what they have learnt can be applied
            correctly. It allows them to make mistakes in a safe space, and
            learn from them before exams. It&apos;s all about making sure the
            learning sticks and preparing them for success, both in class and
            beyond.

            Payments are billed after the tuition month. So if you are
            interested in joining us in September, we will charge you on October
            the 1st the full amount for all lessons in that month. This is
            usually confirmed during the sign up. If you still are not sure
            about joining us, we offer a free-of-charge trial lesson for the
            student. If you are happy with how we run things here, then we can
            process the monthly payment. If not, then no strings attached!

            We currently do not offer pay-as-you-go as a payment option. This is

            If for any reason your child can not attend their lesson, we must be

            another class of ours, either during the weekday or next weekend.

            minute emergencies, please contact us directly and we can deduct the
            missed lesson amounts from your bill next month.

            If you are interested in science tuition - we know that it can be
            rather expensive. So for GCSE Science students only, we offer two

            You can choose the General Science package, where students can do
            one or more lessons per week on any of the three science subjects of
            their choice.
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ my: 1 }}>
            Or you can choose the Separate Science course, where students learn
            Chemistry, Biology and Physics separately throughout the week. You
            can also choose just two, or even one science subject - which is why
            it is one of our most popular services. This option is targeted to
            lower-achieving students who are looking to boost their grade
            quickly and effectively.

            General Science lessons are charged at the normal lesson price and

            throughout the week. They are perfect for high-achieving students
            who need to spend more time reviewing and revising content.
