_Here is the main page for the site. It is a basic static page, providing parents with a brief overview of our services. The content of the site needs to be improved, however this was my first version of the site._

### Feature 1: Material UI Components

![Feature 1](images/responsive-design1.png)
_After completing a course on React, I stopped building components myself and switched to a UI library. I chose Material-UI however looking back, Tailwind would have been a better option as there is a lot of flexibility and customisation available._

---

_Including plugins such as Daisy ui and component libraries such as Shad-cn, that are compatible with Tailwind CSS._

### Feature 2: Next.js SEO features

_Instead of keeping all buttons the same colour, I found other apps dynamically changing colour when interacted with. After implementing, it really improved the feel of the calculator and made it a lot easier on the eyes._
